The target of this project is to develop an helper application to 
optimize the ordering process in an engineering laboratory. 
The term OSCM is an abbreviation for Ordering and Supplier Chain 
Manager. 
Our engineering environment undergoes a lot of chances during an 
academic year. 
This means we have frequent chances of collaborators such as master and 
bachelor students working on short-term projects, as well as PHd 
candidates or part-time collaborators working on CTI projects. 
Because we realize prototypes - meaning development of electronics or 
electro-mechanical devices, we need 3rdParty Suppliers that deliver the 
needed components for realizing. 
This ends in supplier management as well as component ordering tracking,
organization and payment supervising. 
The helper application OSCM should be based on the framework Django â€“ a 
Python based framework. 
We want reduce management over-head, increase tracking capabilities in 
the warehouse process and therefor reduce the overall costs.
